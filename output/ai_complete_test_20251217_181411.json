    "AI_RESPONSE": "Snowflake offers significant benefits for data analytics through its cloud-native architecture that separates storage and compute, allowing for independent scaling and cost optimization. Its multi-cluster shared data architecture enables concurrent workloads without performance degradation, while built-in features like zero-copy cloning, time travel, and seamless handling of semi-structured data streamline analytics workflows. Additionally, Snowflake's consumption-based pricing model and minimal maintenance requirements allow organizations to focus on extracting insights rather than managing infrastructure."
